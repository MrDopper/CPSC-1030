            So, I was chatting with an atom the other day, and I started to feel a bit suspicious. I mean, think about
            it—atoms are
            in everything, right? So, I asked, "Hey, can I trust you?" And the atom just laughed and said, "Of course
            not!
            We
            literally make up everything!" At that point, I realized I'd been duped by the building blocks of the
            universe.
            Turns
            out, even on a microscopic level, things aren't always what they seem!
            I was hanging out with a photon the other day, and we decided to go on a road trip. As we were getting ready
            to leave, I
            asked, "Hey, don’t you need to pack anything?" The photon just shrugged and said, "Nah, I’m traveling
            light." Guess when
            you're a particle of light, you really know how to keep things simple!
